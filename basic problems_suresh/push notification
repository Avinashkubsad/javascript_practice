User Requests Permission

The app requests notification permission from the user.
If granted, a device token (unique identifier) is assigned.
Device Registers with FCM/APNS

The app sends the device token to Firebase (FCM) (Android) or APNS (iOS).
The backend stores this token for sending notifications later.
Server Sends Notification to FCM/APNS

Your backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) sends a notification request to FCM/APNS.
The request includes:
Device Token
Notification Title & Body
Custom Data (if needed)

FCM/APNS Delivers Notification to Device

If the app is foreground, the notification is handled inside the app.
If the app is background/killed, the system displays the notification in the notification tray.

What is Backend?
Backend refers to the server-side of an application that handles the logic, database interactions, 
authentication, and other processes that users don’t directly see. It acts as the brain of an app, 
processing requests from the frontend and sending back the necessary data.
